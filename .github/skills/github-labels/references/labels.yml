notes:
- Keep label names lowercase and stable; avoid renaming existing labels.
- Prefer area:* and domain:* over inventing project-specific labels.
- If a new label is needed, propose it via a 'Label Change Proposal' issue.
- 'For changelog automation: if release:* is missing, infer from conventional commits or default to release:patch.'
- AI agents MUST use labels from this file; creating new labels is prohibited.
- Colors are standardized to ensure visual consistency across repositories.
- When applying labels, check the 'exclusive' flag to avoid conflicts.
ai_instructions:
  constraint: 'You MUST ONLY use labels defined in this taxonomy. NEVER suggest, create, or apply labels that do not exist in this file. If the user requests a label that doesn''t exist, explain why and suggest the closest matching label from this taxonomy.'
  matching_priority:
  - Match the user's intent to the most specific applicable label
  - Prefer exact namespace matches (type:bug vs generic 'bug')
  - When uncertain between two labels, ask for clarification
  - Apply required labels (type, priority) before optional ones
  validation_steps:
  - Verify the label exists in groups[].labels[].name
  - Check exclusive flag before applying multiple from same group
  - Ensure required groups (type, priority) have exactly one label
  - Warn if max_labels_per_issue would be exceeded
